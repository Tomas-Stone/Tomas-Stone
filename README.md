## 🧩 Research & Experience

### 🎓 Research Student — CentraleSupélec  
*Sep 2025 – Present, Paris, FR*  
- Integrated **latent teammate modeling** into world models for cooperative **multi-agent reinforcement learning**.  
- Designed a **Theory-of-Mind head** to infer teammate behavior from partial trajectories.  
- Enabled **zero-shot coordination** by conditioning an actor-critic on inferred teammate latents.

### 💼 Data Scientist Intern — Rakuten  
*Apr 2025 – Sep 2025, Paris, FR*  
- Deployed an **LLM pipeline** on GCP/Airflow, improving product categorization accuracy from 50% → **90%+**.  
- Built a **recommendation system API** for millions of products using temporal and aggregated features.  
- Designed real-time **model evaluation dashboards** in DOMO.

### 🚀 Founder — FitCV  
*Feb 2025 – Aug 2025*  
- Built **FitCV**, an AI-powered CV builder using the **Mistral API**.  
- Developed a **secure full-stack app** with authentication, payments, and an intuitive UI.

### 🧬 Research Assistant — UROP  
*Sep 2023 – Feb 2024, Paris, FR*  
- Built a **deep neural network** to decode directional intent from live **EEG data** for thought-based control.  
- Developed a **personalized fine-tuning protocol** for adaptive 3D avatar control.
